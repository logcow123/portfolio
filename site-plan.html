      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This home page will be a very simple design and will show others what raid they want to learn more about. It will show a picture of the raid and will have text over describing which raid it is. There will be a hero image and there will be a navigation bar for the raids as well. The main point of this page is to show the user what raids are available on the website so they can choose which raid they want to learn more about. The footer will consist of basic information about me so if they have any questions they can contact me through my contact information which will be contained inside the footer as well as my social media links. I feel like this website will do best on mobile devices so I feel like formatting for such will make for a much better user experience
      </p>

      <h3>Deep Stone Crypt Guide</h3>
      <p>
        For the deep stone crypt page there will be many images and text describing the mechanics of the raid. It will start off by explaining how to start the raid and will provide images on how to get your character to the first encounter of the raid. The first encounter of the raid will be explained in simple yet powerful detail and will have images for the user to look at to compare what they see on the website with what they see in game. The explanation might go something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        “Once you start up the raid you will spawn near a fallen camp and you must destroy all of the fallen before the door will open up. After you are let through the door you will follow the path until you reach an area with an airlock. All players must be present inside the airlock for the airlock to let you through. Once through you will find yourself inside a huge orange bubble. With buff on the side of your screen called “shelter from the storm”. For this area the main mechanic works like such: 1: if you're outside of the bubble you gain stacks of frostbite. 2: Once frostbite reaches 10x you die. 3: staying inside of the bubble removes the stacks of frostbite. Inside this part of the raid you must traverse the wasteland finding these bubbles to take shelter then proceed to the next bubble. You repeat this until you reach the final bubble where you fight 2 fallen brigs and find another airlock” 
      </p>
      <p>
        With this explanation there will be photos that the user can look at so they can compare and follow along as they play

      </ul>
      <h3>Garden of Salvation Guide</h3>
      <p>
        The Garden of Salvation Page will go in the same way as the deep stone crypt page and will explain the mechanics of the Garden of Salvation raid. Here is an example of what will go on the garden of Salvation raid page:
      </p>
      <p>
        “To start this raid is very straightforward. You spawn on the moon next to a massive vex portal and you kill all the enemies and the portal opens. Once through this portal you arrive at the first encounter of the raid. There are two main mechanics in the first encounter of this raid. 1st is the “Voltaic Overflow” mechanic which works like such: The Boss will wander around and “spit” out this robotic looking anomaly and if you don’t do anything about it, it wipes the whole team. To stop it you need a player to step over it to pick it up. Doing so gives the player a 2 minute debuff called “Voltaic Overflow”. With this buff you cannot pick up the anomaly again otherwise that player will day. The 2nd mechanic is the tether mechanic. You will see a Tesseract looking block in the sky and you must shoot it to activate it. Once activated it will “tether” itself to the closest player and after that if another player gets close to the “tethered” player the tether will latch itself to another player and continue as such. As a team you must lead this tether to a plus block onto the grid wall to open the door”
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be more of an explanation and there will be more pictures as well to show what I’m talking about for the user.
